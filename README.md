# Easybank Landing Page

This project was made for an university discipline called: Web Programming 1. 

The discipline task is to copy any website I want. I've chosen this project at https://frontendmentor.io, which is a website that offers many projects to do with its requirements, design and images. A really good place to practice front-end web programming. 

## The project
This project is called Easybank, it's a landing page for an online bank.
